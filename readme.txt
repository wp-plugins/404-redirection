Permanently redirect all 404's to the main blog URL. The primary purpose is to salvage Google PageRank (TM) from missing pages.

== Description ==

This simple plugin tracks and permanently redirects all 404's to the main blog URL. There may be several reasons why you might want to do this, but the primary purpose is to siphon Google Page Rank (TM) from missing pages to the homepage.

== Installation ==

The installation process is very basic:

1. Upload the unzipped plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it!

If you're having issues with the installation, you can read detailed instructions here: http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I have to configure anything? =

Nope. The plugin is ready to go once you install it.

= Can you give me some examples for why this plugin may be beneficial to me? =

Sure!

Example #1: If you acquire a pre-owned domain (that you intend to run WordPress with), you might not want to recreate every page that was part of the original site. Alternatively, you might not want to build an exhaustive list of 301's either. Enter the 404 Redirection plugin. Now, you'll never have to worry about not salvaging every drip of link-juice.

Example #2: Let's face it, having an exuberant amount of 404's is bad form. Search engines might consider your site "broken", and drop your rankings.
